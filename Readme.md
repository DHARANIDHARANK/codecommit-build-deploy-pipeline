# CI/CD Pipeline for Deploying an Nginx Application 
This README outlines the process for setting up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline to deploy a simple Nginx application.

## Overview
The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following steps:

Source: The code is hosted in AWS CodeCommit.
Build: AWS CodeBuild builds the Docker image and pushes it to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
Deploy: AWS CodeDeploy deploys the application to an EC2 instance or an ECS cluster using the built Docker image.
Pipeline: AWS CodePipeline automates the entire process by connecting the source, build, and deploy stages.

## Prerequisites
An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline.
An S3 bucket to store pipeline artifacts.
A VPC with subnets and security groups configured for your EC2 instances or ECS cluster.

## Steps to Set Up the CI/CD Pipeline
1. Set Up the Source Repository
Create a repository in AWS CodeCommit and push your application code. The repository should include:

Dockerfile for building the Nginx Docker image.
Application source code (e.g., index.html).
appspec.yml for CodeDeploy configurations.
Deployment scripts (e.g., scripts/installnginx.sh).

## 2. Configure AWS CodeBuild
Create a build project in AWS CodeBuild with the following configurations:

Source: Connect to the CodeCommit repository.
Environment: Choose a managed image with Docker support.
Buildspec: Create a buildspec.yml file in your repository with the following content

## 3. Configure AWS CodeDeploy
Create a deployment application and a deployment group in AWS CodeDeploy:

Application: Name it according to your project (e.g., my-nginx-app).
Deployment Group: Configure it to deploy to your EC2 instances or ECS cluster.
Ensure that the appspec.yml file and deployment scripts are correctly configured to handle the deployment steps.

## 4. Configure AWS CodePipeline
Create a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline with the following stages:

Source: Connect to the CodeCommit repository.
Build: Use the CodeBuild project created earlier.
Deploy: Use the CodeDeploy application and deployment group.

# Summary
This CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Dockerized Nginx application using AWS services. By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth and efficient deployment process, leveraging the power of AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline.
